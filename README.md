# IMDb Movie Ratings Analysis Project

## Overview

This project is part of my Visual Communications and Data Storytelling course, and explores the IMDb Movie Ratings dataset to uncover insights into the ratings, trends, and patterns of movies. The analysis focuses on addressing key questions related to the existence of a "Golden Age" of cinema, the influence of directors on movie ratings, the relationship between genres and ratings, and the impact of runtime on movie ratings.

## Questions Explored

### 1. Was there a Golden Age of Cinema?

The project investigates whether there was a specific period or decade known for producing highly rated movies. By analyzing the distribution of movie ratings over time, the goal is to identify any patterns or trends that suggest the presence of a "Golden Age" of cinema.

### 2. Are Certain Directors More Likely to Produce Highly Rated Films?

The analysis delves into the influence of directors on movie ratings. By identifying directors associated with highly rated films, the project aims to uncover patterns and determine whether certain directors consistently produce movies with better ratings.

### 3. Are There Certain Genres That Are Better Rated in General?

The exploration extends to understanding the relationship between movie genres and ratings. By analyzing the average ratings across different genres, the project seeks to identify genres that tend to receive higher ratings and those that may be less favorably rated.

### 4. Is There an Optimal Runtime for Higher Ratings?

The project investigates whether the length of a movie influences its rating. By exploring the relationship between runtime and ratings, the goal is to identify whether shorter or longer films, or a specific range of runtimes, are associated with higher ratings.

## Project Findings

The findings of the project will be summarized based on the analyses conducted for each question. Insights gained from the exploration will provide a better understanding of the factors that contribute to movie ratings on IMDb.
